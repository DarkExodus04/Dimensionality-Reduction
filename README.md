<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This report is made for the purpose of Project 2 of the course EEL5934: Applied Machine learning systems. The data set used for the project are images of handwritten digits. According to the mentioned requirements, the appropriate are dimensionality techniques and estimators are used in the project and the corresponding decisions and explanations are given.

<!-- Files-->
## Files and Directories
- **Supermarket sales.csv** : The Dataset on which the project is done.
- **training.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook file where the data is explored, preprocessed and trained.
- **test.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook file for testing and evaliating performance on the test sets.
- **test.pdf**: PDF version of Jupyter notebook file for testing and evaliating performance on the test sets.
- **training.pdf**: PDF version of Jupyter notebook file for testing and evaliating performance on the test sets.
- **models**: Directory for storing trained models. The test file uses loads the models from this directory.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The project runs on Python UFRC Python-3.10 on Hipergator.
Important Libraries required are as follows:

 - Scikit Learn
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Numpy
 
### Installation

1. Clone the repo in the Hipergator
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UF-AppliedMLSystems-Fall23/project-2-NathanNoronha
 ```
2. Download the Models and put the downloaded Models in the "Models" Directory
3. Put Data sets in the Data folder
4. Run training.ipynb file and let it save the models in the models directory.
5. Run test.ipynb file to test on the testing data set.

### Using a different dataset
1. Add the dataset in the same directory as the test and training files.
2. Run the training file and change the required data preprocessing parameters and training parameters.
3. Run the test file.
